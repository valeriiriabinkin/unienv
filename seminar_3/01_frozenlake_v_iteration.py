"""
The value iteration method.

r(s, a) - reward of action from given state,
V(s) - value (or total expected reward) of the state,
Q(s, a) - value of the action, total reward we can get by executing action 'a' in state 's'.

1. Initialize the values of all states, V_i, to some initial value (usually zero).
2. For every state, s, in the MDP, perform the Bellman update V_s.
3. Repeat step 2 for some large number of steps or until changes become too small.
